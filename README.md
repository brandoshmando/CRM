CRM
===
 The CRM was an assignment I had while at [Bitmaker Labs]('http://bitmakerlabs.com'). This was my first real dive into Object Oriented programming and well, it's ugly. It was supposed to be a command line customer relationship management tool, but halfway through I realized how ugly it was becoming. I decided to rewrite the project from the start and came out with a much [cleaner and DRY'er version](https://github.com/brandoshmando/rewrite_CRM).
