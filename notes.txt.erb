The "Old Days":

	The waterfall method
		-Meet with client once, take all info and "send it". Come back to company, and usually not what they wanted. Mainly because they dont know what they want.

	Iterative Development
		-More of a loob before deployment
		-MVP == Minimum Viable Product
		-After MVP, generally deploying new feature/fix everyday

	User sotries
		-Start of with "As a user..."
		-Used to list out requirements

	Trello, Sifter, Pivotal Tracker etc.
